# React Native Unistyles Advanced Styling Guide

Comprehensive styling guidelines using react-native-unistyles for scalable, performant, and maintainable React Native applications.

## Core Styling Principles

- **Zero Inline Styles**: ALL styling must use Unistyles - never inline styles
- **Theme-Driven Design**: Use theme values for all design tokens
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for theme and style definitions
- **Performance First**: Optimize for runtime performance and memory usage
- **Responsive Design**: Support multiple screen sizes and orientations
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Full light/dark theme support

## Theme Architecture

### Theme Structure

- Define semantic colors (primary, secondary, accent)
- Include neutral colors (background, surface, card)
- Organize text colors by hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary, inverse)
- Add status colors (success, warning, error, info)
- Create interactive color states (default, hover, pressed, disabled)
- Define border colors for different states

### Spacing System

- Use consistent spacing scale (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl, xxxl)
- Base spacing on 4px or 8px grid system
- Apply spacing consistently across all components
- Use semantic spacing names rather than pixel values

### Typography Scale

- Define font families (regular, medium, semiBold, bold)
- Create consistent font size scale
- Match line heights to font sizes appropriately
- Use system fonts for better performance

### Border Radius System

- Create consistent border radius scale
- Use semantic names (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, full)
- Apply consistently across components
- Consider platform-specific preferences

### Shadow System

- Define shadow levels (sm, md, lg)
- Include both iOS and Android shadow properties
- Use elevation for Android, shadow properties for iOS
- Maintain visual consistency across platforms

### Theme Configuration

- Register themes with UnistylesRegistry
- Support adaptive themes for system preference
- Set appropriate initial theme
- Enable theme switching capabilities

## Styling Patterns

### Component Styling Structure

- Use createStyleSheet for component styles
- Access theme and runtime parameters
- Support component variants through style variants
- Handle responsive design with runtime conditions
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props

### Layout Components

- Create reusable layout utilities (flex, alignment, containers)
- Use semantic layout patterns (container, safeContainer, card, section)
- Apply consistent spacing and sizing
- Support responsive layout patterns

## Advanced Patterns

### Responsive Design

- Use runtime screen width for breakpoint-based styling
- Implement adaptive containers for different screen sizes
- Create responsive grid systems
- Handle orientation changes appropriately

### Animation Support

- Prepare styles for animations with transform and opacity
- Support hover states for web platforms
- Handle pressed states for touch interactions
- Use appropriate animation-ready properties

### Complex Component Styling

- Structure styles for complex components logically
- Use variants for different component states
- Handle interactive states consistently
- Apply proper accessibility considerations

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Style Patterns

- Use Unistyles variants for conditional styling (not inline conditionals)
- Leverage runtime conditions efficiently within createStyleSheet
- Avoid recalculating styles outside of Unistyles patterns
- Group related style variations together

### Conditional Styling

- Use variants instead of inline conditionals
- Group related style variations together
- Minimize runtime style calculations
- Use efficient conditional patterns

## Best Practices

### Theme Token Usage

- Always use theme tokens instead of hardcoded values
- Reference theme colors, spacing, and typography consistently
- Avoid magic numbers in styles
- Use semantic naming for theme values

### Component Composition

- Create reusable style utilities
- Use utility classes for common patterns
- Compose styles efficiently
- Avoid style duplication

### Platform-Specific Styling

- Handle iOS-specific shadow properties
- Use Android elevation appropriately
- Apply web-specific styles when needed
- Test across all target platforms

## Testing Styles

### Style Testing Utilities

- Test theme color application
- Verify responsive behavior
- Test theme switching functionality
- Validate accessibility properties

### Testing Strategy

- Unit test style calculations
- Integration test theme changes
- Visual regression testing
- Cross-platform consistency testing

This comprehensive Unistyles configuration ensures scalable, maintainable, and performant styling that adapts to different themes, screen sizes, and platforms while maintaining excellent developer experience.
