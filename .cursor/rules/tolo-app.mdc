## Design Philosophy

- **Clean & Modern**: Minimalist UI with focus on content
- **Performance First**: Fast loading, smooth animations, optimized rendering
- **Accessible Design**: Screen reader support, proper contrast, scalable text
- **Consistent Experience**: Uniform spacing, typography, and interaction patterns
- **Mobile Optimized**: Touch-friendly interface with proper gesture handling

## Code Priorities

The codebase should prioritize the following qualities in order of importance:

1. **Simplicity**: Code should be straightforward and easy to understand. Avoid over-engineering and complex abstractions when simple solutions suffice.
2. **Modernity**: Use current best practices, modern APIs, and up-to-date patterns. Stay current with React Native, TypeScript, and ecosystem standards.
3. **Legibility**: Code should be self-documenting with clear naming, proper structure, and logical organization. Prioritize readability over cleverness.
4. **Elegance**: Solutions should be graceful and well-crafted. Seek clean, efficient implementations that feel natural and well-designed.

These priorities guide all technical decisions and ensure the codebase remains maintainable, approachable, and future-ready.

## Technical Standards

### Core Technologies

- **Styling**: React Native Unistyles for ALL styling (never inline styles)
- **Internationalization**: Lingui for ALL user-facing text (never hardcoded strings)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for client state
- **TanStack Query**: ALWAYS use `queryOptions` and `mutationOptions` from `@tanstack/react-query` for type safety and reusability
- **No Custom Query Hooks**: AVOID creating custom hooks that only wrap `useQuery` with `queryOptions`. Use `useQuery(queryOptions)` directly in components instead. Custom hooks should only be created when they add meaningful logic beyond the basic query call.
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with typed routes
- **Package Manager**: bun (never npm or yarn)
- **React Imports**: Never import React default - import specific APIs only

### File Naming Conventions

- **ALL files**: kebab-case naming (e.g., `language-context.tsx`, `use-color-scheme.ts`)
- **Components**: PascalCase exports from kebab-case files
- **Hooks**: camelCase exports starting with 'use' from kebab-case files
- **Utilities**: camelCase exports from kebab-case files

### Code Organization

- **Feature-based structure**: Group related components, hooks, and utilities
- **Barrel exports**: Use index files for clean imports
- **Single responsibility**: Each file should have one primary purpose
- **Separation of concerns**: Logic, UI, and styling clearly separated
- **Avoid Classes**: Prefer simple objects and functions over classes. Classes add unnecessary complexity when simple objects work just fine. Use factory functions or plain objects with methods instead.
- **Absolute imports**: ALWAYS prefer absolute imports over relative imports when navigating one or more levels behind. Use `@/` prefix for imports from the src directory instead of relative paths like `../`. This improves code readability, makes refactoring easier, and prevents import path issues when moving files.

### Development Workflow Standards

#### Package Management

- **ALWAYS use bun**: Never npm or yarn for dependency installation
- **Install bun first**: If bun not available, run `npm install -g bun` before proceeding
- **Dependency installation**: ALWAYS use `bun install` or `bun add <package>` for installing dependencies
- **Update dependencies**: Run `bun install` after any dependency changes
- **Verify compatibility**: Run `bunx expo install --fix` after React Native deps
- **Format code**: Run `bun run format` after completing tasks
- **Lint check**: Run `bun run lint` and fix errors after completing tasks

#### Error Handling & Monitoring

- **Sentry Integration**: Capture all errors with proper context
- **Graceful Degradation**: App should handle network failures elegantly
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear, actionable error messages
- **Logging**: Include relevant context for debugging

### Performance Requirements

#### Rendering Optimization

- **Memoization**: Use React.memo for expensive components
- **Virtualization**: FlatList for any lists with >10 items
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy load non-critical screens
- **Image Optimization**: Use Expo Image with proper sizing and formats

#### Bundle Optimization

- **Tree Shaking**: Ensure unused code is eliminated
- **Dynamic Imports**: Load features on demand
- **Asset Optimization**: Compress images and use appropriate formats

#### Runtime Performance

- **60fps Target**: Maintain smooth animations and scrolling
- **Memory Management**: Avoid memory leaks in subscriptions and timers
- **Battery Efficiency**: Minimize background processing

### Quality Assurance

#### Code Quality

- **TypeScript Strict**: No `any` types, proper interfaces
- **ESLint**: Follow configured rules without exceptions
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **KISS Principle**: Keep implementations simple and straightforward

#### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Critical business logic and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: User flows and component interactions
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- **Performance Tests**: Bundle size and runtime performance

#### Code Review Standards

- **Self Review**: Check your own code before submission
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for complex functions only (avoid trivial docs)
- **Commit Messages**: Follow Conventional Commits v1.0.0 specification
- **PR Size**: Keep changes focused and reviewable

### Accessibility Standards

#### Screen Reader Support

- **Accessibility Labels**: Meaningful labels for all interactive elements
- **Semantic Structure**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmarks
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and focus indicators
- **Announcements**: Important state changes communicated to users

#### Visual Accessibility

- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance minimum
- **Text Scaling**: Support for dynamic text sizing
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44pt touch targets
- **Visual Indicators**: Don't rely solely on color for information

### Platform Considerations

#### iOS Specific

- **Safe Areas**: Proper handling of notches and home indicators
- **Haptic Feedback**: Appropriate use of system haptics
- **iOS Design Patterns**: Follow platform conventions

#### Android Specific

- **Edge-to-Edge**: Proper handling of system bars
- **Material Design**: Follow Android design principles
- **Back Button**: Proper back navigation handling

#### Web (if applicable)

- **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different screen sizes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **SEO Optimization**: Proper meta tags and structure

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### Development Efficiency

- **Focused Responses**: Avoid verbose summaries unless requested
- **Minimal Changes**: Only implement what's specifically requested
- **Context Awareness**: Understand existing patterns before suggesting changes
- **Token Efficiency**: Provide concise, actionable guidance
- **No Task Summaries**: NEVER output summaries of changes after completing tasks unless explicitly requested
- **No Documentation Files**: NEVER create README files or documentation files - code should be self-documenting

### Code Generation Preferences

- **Follow Patterns**: Respect existing codebase patterns and conventions
- **Modern Practices**: Use current React Native and Expo best practices
- **Type Safety**: Always include proper TypeScript types
- **Performance Minded**: Consider performance implications of suggestions
- **Correct Imports**: Never import React default, use specific API imports only

### Documentation Standards

- **Minimal JSDoc**: Only document complex or non-obvious functions
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Prefer clear naming over extensive comments - code should explain itself
- **No READMEs**: NEVER create README files or documentation files - the code should be self-documenting through clear naming, proper structure, and minimal JSDoc where truly needed
- **API Documentation**: Document public interfaces and hooks only when complexity requires it

## Common Patterns

### Import Patterns

- **React Hooks**: `import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'`
- **React Native**: `import { View, Text, Pressable } from 'react-native'`
- **Lingui**: `import { Trans } from '@lingui/react/macro'` and `import { t } from '@lingui/core/macro'`
- **Never**: `import React from 'react'` (not needed in modern React Native)

### Component Structure

- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Import specific React hooks as needed
- Export components with PascalCase names from kebab-case files

### Hook Pattern

- Import specific hooks from React
- Create custom hooks with clear return interfaces
- Use proper dependency arrays

### Error Handling Pattern

- Log errors to Sentry with proper context
- Provide user-friendly feedback
- Implement graceful fallbacks

This configuration ensures consistent, high-quality development while maintaining the simplicity and performance focus that defines the TOLO coffee shop experience.
